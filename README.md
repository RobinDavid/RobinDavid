Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Here are some of the tools I am developing or working/worked on.

## Projects

**Fuzzing / Symbolic Execution**:
* [**PASTIS**](https://github.com/quarkslab/pastis): Collaborative fuzzing infrastructure. It leverages AFL++, Honggfuzz and TritonDSE (thus greybox and whitebox fuzzing) for program coverage and bug discovery.
* [**TritonDSE**](https://github.com/quarkslab/tritondse): Symbolic Execution engine based on [Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton) built for automatic program coverage exploration. It has been design to encompass multiple program analysis use-cases.

**Deobfuscation / Program Synthesis**:
* [**Qsynthesis**](https://github.com/quarkslab/qsynthesis): Program synthesizer geared for deobfuscation. It leverages, [Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton) for symbolic execution, and also [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb), [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) [llvmlite](https://github.com/numba/llvmlite), [capstone](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone)
* [**idasec**](https://github.com/RobinDavid/idasec): *(unmaintained anymore)*, opaque predicate deobfuscation, trace generation via an IDA Pro plugin (using [Binsec](https://binsec.github.io))

**Diffing / Firmware Analysis**: [Portal](https://diffing.quarkslab.com)
* [**QBinDiff**](https://github.com/quarkslab/qbindiff): Binary differ, based on Network Alignment and Belief Propagation
* [**python-bindiff**](https://github.com/quarkslab/python-bindiff): Python wrapper and API for Bindiff
* [**python-binexport**](https://github.com/quarkslab/python-binexport): Python wrapper and API for BinExport

**Other**:
* [**pydimacs**](https://github.com/RobinDavid/pydimacs), simple module to manipule CNF (Conjonctive Normal Form), graphs using Z3 Python API

and more to come..
